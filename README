To compile:
-----------
gfortran -c constants.f90
gfortran -c dusta.f90

make -B -f makefile

diskevolfast is the executable, type this to run simulation

Inputs:
------
These are in the directory inputs, you should not have to modify anything here
Main file is diskevol.inp, there are many extra files here, ignore them (do not delete any)

Output:
---------
The output is in the folder models: [gets re-written each time code is executed]

The file format is as follows

nr 
blank
[array of quantity] 1200 for each radial point at t=t0
blank
[array of quantity] 1200 for each radial point at t=t1
blank and so on

Most files have this format, sigmadust has a column of 10 values corresponding to the grains sizes, each column is the sigma for that dust size. 

time.info - contains the number of time steps
time.dat  - contains the simulation times.
rgrid.inp - radial grid (this is in ./input you may have to copy it over)

Plots:
------
there are some python scripts, sigma_anim.py runs a time lapse of all the surface densities.
Looking at that should give you some idea of file structure..
